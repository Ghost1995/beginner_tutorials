# ROS Publisher/Subscriber

## Overview
This program is a basic implementation of a publisher and a subscriber in ROS. It has been generated by creating a catkin package, editing the default package.xml and CMakeLists.txt, and then creating two nodes, a publisher (talker) node and a subscriber (listener) node to demonstarte how they interact with each other.

## Dependencies
This program works on a device running Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic.
To install ROS Kinetic in Ubuntu 16.04, follow the steps in this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu).
To install catkin, follow the installation steps in this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin).

## Build and Run Instructions
There are two ways to run this code.
#### Method 1
To build this code in a catkin workspace:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/
git clone https://github.com/Ghost1995/beginner_tutorials.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
Note, that if you do not have a catkin workspace, then first make the catkin workspace using the following command:
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
```
Now, to run this code, three terminals are required.
Set environment vairables and run roscore in Terminal 1:
```
roscore
```
Set environment variables and run publisher (talker) node in Terminal 2:
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials talker
```
Set environment variables and run subscriber (listener) node in Terminal 3:
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials listener
```
#### Method 2
If you do not want to build this code in a catkin workspace:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ghost1995/beginner_tutorials.git
cd beginner_tutorials
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Now, to run this code, three terminals are required.
Set environment vairables and run roscore in Terminal 1:
```
roscore
```
Set environment variables and run publisher (talker) node in Terminal 2:
```
cd <path to directory>
./build/devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/talker
```
Set environment variables and run subscriber (listener) node in Terminal 3:
```
cd <path to directory>
./build/devel/lib/beginner_tutorials/listener
```

## Plugins
